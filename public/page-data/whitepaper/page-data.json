Indeed, with regard to his actions, the society will decide whether or not to remunerate him through the price of his IHVPT. Thus, short selling or long buying actions are not allowed by a single individual but by all of the individuals who have bet on others. In addition, in order to avoid insider trading, each IHVPTs buyer or seller will need to authenticate and their identity will be known only to the HVSE. Admittedly, advices could be provided by each holder of each IHVPT to tokenized people but HVSE regulation will take place in order to limit advices encouraging extreme atitudes.

Strongly established, initiator of the media and public madness for cryptocurrencies, it suffers from regularly pointed out shortcomings, such as its slowness, its relatively small block size, in particular.","hist4":"The second generation","hist5":" (2011) presents either minor improvements or technological innovations allowing new functions. The archetype  is Ethereum (which is derived from the source code of Bitcoin), which makes use of smart contracts.","hist6":"The third generation","hist7":" (since 2017): Noticing new limitations, notably in capacity, security and governance. New cryptocurrencies have emerged, such as EOS.IO, Cardano (ADA), AION, ICON (ICX) and Raiden Network (RDN), for the best known. EOS.IO is itself derived from Ethereum. They bring innovations, but, in August 2018, none has gained the upper hand over the others.","curtok":"1.2. A new currency or a new token?","curtok1":"Typically, crypto tokens are programmable, permissionless, trustless, and transparent. Programmable simply means that they run on software protocols, which are composed of smart contracts that outline the features and functions of the token and the network’s rules of engagement. Permissionless means that anyone can participate in the system without the need for special credentials. Trustless means that no one central authority controls the system; instead it runs on the rules predefined by the network protocol. And finally, transparency implies that the rules of the protocol and its transactions are viewable and verifiable by all.","curtok2":" While crypto tokens, like cryptocurrency, can hold value and be exchanged, they can also be designed to represent physical assets or more traditional digital assets, or a certain utility or service. For instance, there are crypto tokens that represent tangible assets such as real estate and art, as well as intangible assets such as processing power or data storage space. Tokens are also frequently used as a governance mechanism for voting on specific parameters like protocol upgrades and other decisions that dictate the future direction of various blockchain projects. The process of creating crypto tokens to serve these various functions is known as tokenization.","curtok3":"After our market study, we have concluded that a new currency can't offer several new things. Indeed, our personal profits in this enterprise don't matter. So, we have chosen to create a new token and not a new cryptocurrency.","curtok4":" HVSEcoin is a ERC20 token based on the Ether. This choice was conducted due to different reasons:","curtok5":" 1. a solid network of applications;","curtok6":" 2. a mutation in progress from the Proof of Work consensus mechanism to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism (thanks to ETH 2.0);","curtok7":" 3. ERC20 allows for seamless interaction)ith other smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens that have some but not all of the standard functions are considered to be partially ERC20 compliant and can still be easy for external parties to interact with depending upon which functions are missing.","curtok8":" We define 'staking' as the action to bet HVSEcoin on a person."}}},
