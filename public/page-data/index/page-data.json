In addition, in order to avoid insider trading, each IHVPTs buyer or seller will need to authenticate and their identity will be known only to the HVSE.

Strongly established, initiator of the media and public madness for cryptocurrencies, it suffers from regularly pointed out shortcomings, such as its slowness, its relatively small block size, in particular.","hist4":"The second generation","hist5":" (2011) presents either minor improvements or technological innovations allowing new functions. The archetype  is Ethereum (which is derived from the source code of Bitcoin), which makes use of smart contracts.","hist6":"The third generation","hist7":" (since 2017): Noticing new limitations, notably in capacity, security and governance. New cryptocurrencies have emerged, such as EOS.IO, Cardano (ADA), AION, ICON (ICX) and Raiden Network (RDN), for the best known. EOS.IO is itself derived from Ethereum. They bring innovations, but, in August 2018, none has gained the upper hand over the others.","curtok":"1.2. Crypto/token?","curtok1":"Typically, crypto tokens are programmable, permissionless, trustless, and transparent. Programmable simply means that they run on software protocols, which are composed of smart contracts that outline the features and functions of the token and the networkâ€™s rules of engagement. Permissionless means that anyone can participate in the system without the need for special credentials. Trustless means that no one central authority controls the system; instead it runs on the rules predefined by the network protocol. And finally, transparency implies that the rules of the protocol and its transactions are viewable and verifiable by all.","curtok2":" While crypto tokens, like cryptocurrency, can hold value and be exchanged, they can also be designed to represent physical assets or more traditional digital assets, or a certain utility or service. For instance, there are crypto tokens that represent tangible assets such as real estate and art, as well as intangible assets such as processing power or data storage space. Tokens are also frequently used as a governance mechanism for voting on specific parameters like protocol upgrades and other decisions that dictate the future direction of various blockchain projects. The process of creating crypto tokens to serve these various functions is known as tokenization.","curtok3":"After our market study, we have concluded that a new currency can't offer several new things. Indeed, our personal profits in this enterprise don't matter. So, we have chosen to create a new token and not a new cryptocurrency.","curtok4":" HVSEcoin is a ERC20 token based on the Ether. This choice was conducted due to different reasons:","curtok5":" 1. a solid network of applications;","curtok6":" 2. a mutation in progress from the Proof of Work consensus mechanism to the Proof of Stake consensus mechanism (thanks to ETH 2.0);","curtok7":" 3. ERC20 allows for seamless interaction)ith other smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens that have some but not all of the standard functions are considered to be partially ERC20 compliant and can still be easy for external parties to interact with depending upon which functions are missing.","curtok8":" We define 'staking' as the action to bet HVSEcoin on a person.","prob":"1.3. Societal and way of life problems ","probb":"1.3.Problems","prob1":" Our society makes a noise: it growls.  However, few people can hear it.There is one million questions to ask, but anyone ask the good ones. Actually, there is only noise. The society in this globality is going to known economic, cultural, social and politic changes as the world has never known.","prob2":"The cleverest are the dumbest. Resources needs are going to rise sharply. We need an Odyssian education. Religious extremism is experiencing unprecedented development. In Western countries, inter-generational inequalities are widening like never before. We need an alliance between Apollonian rationality and Dionysian intituition.This is observations and necessities (or sophisms) conglomeration, that we must integrate and therefore act accordingly.","prob3":"The fact that we are in a phase of transition towards a new societal model having been established, it is fashionable to affirm that monetary dematerialization will play a significant role there. A new problematic is added to this: the need to surpass one's condition while having the societal levers (going beyond one's origin social class) blocked.","prob4":"Actually, some start-ups have put the idea on the cryptocurrencies way (","prob5":"...). However, they are only based on the ideas; we consider that our humanity is not only based on ideas (as certain Myers-Briggs Type Indicator results might lead one to believe it) but on physical aspects too. Therefore,we would like to capitalize and to assess human values thanks to different parameters: ideas, finance, sociability, health...","prob6":"Contrary to the previously cited examples, the HVSE project wishes to avoid the main pitfall committed by mankind: the cypherpunks dream destructuration. Indeed, the initial dream of cypherpunks, like Satoshi Nakamoto, was to build technologies in order to escape to centralizing authorities. However, human nature making new entities has invaded the cryptocurrencies world: Coinbase, Binance, OpenSea ... Thus, we have pledged: ","prob7":"to keep our technology open-source,","prob8":"that our profits will only cover operating costs (including the salaries of employees),","prob9":"a total transparency will exist in the treatment of the data collected,","prob10":"that the value of a man is not judged by a central body but by the human society and itself.","HVSEphilosophy":"2.1. Philosophy","General":"2.1.1. Generalities","General1":"Pavlov has shown that humans could be conditioned as other animals. This reward circus previously described in a certain way constitutes the psycho-physiological basis of leitmotif concept. When the social elevator has practically disappeared and when the social class freeing hope is weak, the existence of a social lever could only be saving.","General2":"What is needed is an objective criterion to assess human value on an individual scale. Thanks to big data technologies, we could produce an index based upon personal trackers: health, finance, social life,...","General3":"A centralizing body setting itself the value of a person would be a denial of the crypto-currencies principles. As Eric Hughes wrote in 1993 in his ","General4":"manifest","General5":"'Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.'","General6":"Indeed, the HVSE concept strives to model the societal capital of a person according to the society point of view. In this way, the favoritism absence face to popular sentiment, which once was only an utopia, could thus become a reality. Everyone should thus prove their usefulness to society in various ways to obtain financial leverage (thanks to their tokenization).","Applied":"2.1.2. Applied","Applied1":"This way, even if we don't believe in HVSE, and we don't believe in HVSEcoin, and we don't believe in the tokenized person, and we don't believe in IHVPTs, we cannot fail to believe in the impact that society has on us and that we are having on it! Indeed, thanks to HVSE technology, this interaction is verifiable!","Applied2":"The main problem with this lies in anonymity. Indeed, it is necessary both to deal with the anonymity necessary for the IHVPTs holders / gamblers but to ensure the real identity of these in order to prohibit the mass actions of bots. This is why we created HVSE in order to overcome this problem while respecting the standards of consent of both the person betting and the person on whom we bet!","Applied3":"Another major point concerning personal data, their means of collection and their use. Indeed, unlike GAFAs, we do not wish to collect data in order to create personalized advertisements, to resell them or to use them for other harmful purposes! Each data collected concerning a tokenized person (editor's note. With an IHVPT in his name) will be immediately published on the page dedicated to this IHVPT. In this way, all the community will be aware of the existence of this new data. In addition, each of the things specific to the HVSE foundation (HVSEcore, HVSEcoin blockchain, HVSE website, IHVPT blockchain ...) will be available in open-source on our Github repository. In this way, transparency will be queen in the matter.","Business":"2.2.

New FAIRs are minted by the DAT, which increases the price of FAIRs. Part of the money invested goes to the organization and part of it is held back by the DAT in its buy-back reserve.","des9":"Selling FAIRs","des10":". The FAIRs sold are burnt by the DAT, which decreases the price of FAIRs, and the DAT refunds the investor with ETH using its buy-back reserve.","des11":"DAT receiving payement","des12":". A payment fraction is used by the DAT to mint new FAIRs (increase both the price of FAIRs and the buy-back reserve). Those newly minted FAIRs are distributed to the current FAIRs holders.
